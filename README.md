My Dotfiles
=======================

Inspired by [James Linder's setup](https://github.com/jlinder/dotfiles)  

1. Clone the repo to `~/dotfiles`

2. Install oh-my-zsh
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

3. Run the bootstrap

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```
